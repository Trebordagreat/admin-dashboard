TOP project.

This project is going to improve my skills using CSS grid.  Personally, I feel confident with the CSS grid functions already, and I believe this project will not be as hard as others in this curriculum.  I will likely be proved wrong.  I am going to mimick the project page shared in the curriculum.  The first step will be designing the page layout.  The next step will be adding the child elements in each section.  After that, I will be adding the actual content onto the page.  Finally, I will debug any issues that appear.

The project is now completed.  In total this took me about six hours to create.  Each section took me approximately an hour and a half to correctly construct and add media for.  The last quarter was spent trying to get the page to be responsive without resulting in a wonky layout.  As I go through these projects, I am learning that there are many limitations with what you can do with web design.  An example is I was trying to get different amount of lines to show up in project cards with different heights, but I figured out this cannot be done using CSS and HTML.  Perhaps, Javascript can help with that.  Overall, I think this was a good practice.  Honestly, I do not think there is more to be done here except for possibly a few minor design tweaks.  Design is not my strong suit, but this was good practice.
