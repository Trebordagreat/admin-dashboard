TOP project.

This project is going to improve my skills using CSS grid.  Personally, I feel confident with the CSS grid functions already, and I believe this project will not be as hard as others in this curriculum.  I will likely be proved wrong.  I am going to mimick the project page shared in the curriculum.  The first step will be designing the page layout.  The next step will be adding the child elements in each section.  After that, I will be adding the actual content onto the page.  Finally, I will debug any issues that appear.
